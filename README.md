# REST API - File Management System

This is a simple REST API that provides file management functionality, including the ability to upload, download, delete, and list files. User authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is implemented, allowing users to manage their own files when logged in. Files are connected to each user's account and cannot be accessed by other users. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
